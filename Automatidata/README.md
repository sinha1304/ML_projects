## Automatidata Project

You have been hired as a data analyst at a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.

### This project involves several steps as follows:

# 1. Foundations of data science:

The first part of the project involves planning for the data project and create a project proposal. We create a PACE framework in this step to organize and plan our next steps.

# 2. Python as the Tool

In this project, we will use python as our programming tool due to it being easy to use and powerful to apply. Using python, we can understand the data at a glance in our early steps. We will perform tasks like building a TLC dataset, examine data type of the features provided and gather descriptive statistics of the dataframe. We will prepare the data to be ready for exploratory data analysis which is the next step.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this stage, we perform EDA and data cleaning. We also build certain visualizations to understand the relationships between relevant variables. We, then, share the results with Automatidata team.

# 4. Statistical Analysis
This step involves exploring the project data and implement a hypothesis test. The results and insights are then communicated with team members and TLC stakeholders.

# 5. Regression Analysis
Finally, we determine the correct modelling approach and build a regression model. We check the model assumptions and evaluate the model performance. The model results are then interpreted and summarized findings are shared with the stakeholders.
