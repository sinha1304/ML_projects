### Project Title: 
**Pinnacle Bank Loan Performance Analysis and Dashboard Development**

### Project Overview:
The "Bank Loan Performance Analysis and Dashboard Development" project aims to analyze bank loan data across the United States to identify trends and factors influencing the categorization of loans as 'good' or 'bad'. Utilizing SQL for data queries and Tableau for dashboard creation, the project provides an interactive and insightful tool for bank stakeholders to understand loan performance, make data-driven decisions, and mitigate risks.

### Objectives:
1. **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical bank loan data to determine key factors that differentiate 'good' loans from 'bad' loans.
2. **Data Queries**: Use SQL to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Create an interactive dashboard in Tableau that visualizes loan performance, highlighting trends and critical factors.
4. **Trend Identification**: Identify patterns and trends in loan performance over time and across different demographics and geographic locations.
5. **Risk Assessment**: Provide insights that help in assessing the risk of future loans.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather comprehensive loan data from various bank branches across the United States. This data includes loan amount, term, interest rate, borrower details (e.g., credit score, income), repayment status, and other relevant variables.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies using SQL for data manipulation and ensuring data quality. The early data cleaning and preparation showed that the data looks okay besides some missing value in "emp_title". Since this feature is not important for our purpose, we can proceed with the data file.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover initial insights and patterns.
   - Use SQL queries to identify factors influencing loan performance.
4. **SQL Queries**:
   - Write SQL queries to perform data extraction and complex calculations.
   - Ensure that the results from these queries are consistent and accurate, forming the backbone of the dashboard data.
5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop an interactive dashboard using Tableau.
   - Include key metrics such as the number of good vs. bad loans, default rates, loan distribution by region, borrower demographics, and more.
   - Provide filtering options to allow users to drill down into specific segments of the data.

### Outcomes:
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly, interactive dashboard in Tableau that allows bank stakeholders to visualize and explore loan data effectively.
- **Insightful Reports**: Detailed reports on the factors influencing loan performance, supported by SQL query results.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identification of high-risk areas and borrower profiles to inform future lending strategies and risk management practices.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Improved ability for bank management to make data-driven decisions regarding loan approval and risk assessment.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Database Management**: SQL for data querying and manipulation.
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau for dashboard creation.


### Conclusion:
This project aims to empower banks with deeper insights into their loan portfolios through robust data analysis using SQL and a comprehensive Tableau dashboard. By leveraging data effectively, banks can improve their loan approval processes, minimize risks, and enhance overall financial stability.
